# SDG-Modelling
Preliminary PhD Research: Using factor analyses and regression modelling on UN Global Goals data.

This submission consists of working with World Bank and UN data relating to the SDGs. Data wrangling, restructuring, visualisation, modelling, and Principal Component Analysis is performed. Structure It is comprised of 6 components:
- 3 Jupyter Notebooks which wrangle and visualise data [0,1,2] 
- 2 Jupyter Notebooks which perform predictions based on models previously developed for Child Mortality [3,4]
- One R script which performs PCA factor analysis on different datasets

Packages The only additional Python package used is the World Bank API: 
- wbdata
The additional R packages used are:
- PerformanceAnalytics 
- FactoMineR 
- factoextra 
- lavaan
